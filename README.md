This is a project of a motif lookup algorithm.
Our intention and goal is to provide further analysis to the analsis provided by the REIN algorithm.
The purpose for these analyses is to help conclude which solution is more likely in the real world.

The algorithm provides the following analyses for the solutions sets obtained from the REIN algorithm - 
1. Visual analysis that includes figures that help interpert the data (elaborate on the figures).
2. A motif analysis for each solution separately.
3. A tool for motif lookup in the solutions.

The motif analysis is done using Brute-Force algorithm or Nauty algorithm (obtained from gTries scanner).
The tool was only tested on Ubuntu.

To install the tool and all necessary packages run the following script through the terminal - 'install.sh'

After installing in the same terminal
